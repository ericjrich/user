  # - \b  Backspace character. It moves the cursor one position to the left.
  # - \r  Carriage return. It brings the cursor back to the beginning of the line.
  # - \v  Vertical tab. A lesser-known one, but it can add a unique touch to your output.
  # - \a  The bell character. It makes your terminal emit a bell sound. Rock on!

  # - \033  This is the octal representation of the escape character. Great for more complex formatting.
